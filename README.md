# Simple Inventory Tracker
Simple CRUD functionality connected to a deployed SQL database. Adds, updates, reads and deletes from the a database. 
Using Nodejs & Express backend, with reactjs frontend. 
MySQL as the relational database management system, deployed online through Heroku. 

# How to Run
1. Install node 
2. CD to chosen directory - Git clone https://github.com/alegueri/SimpleInventoryTracker.git OR download folder as ZIP. 
3. CD into 'server', run "npm install" 
4. CD into 'client', run "npm install"
5. In the client directory, run the command "npm run dev". This command executes both the front-end and the back-end concurrently. 
6. Ensure wifi network is stable, and that the database is connected. The console should indicate a "connected" message. 
7. The front-end will run through 'http://localhost:3000/' in the browser automatically where the interface can be seen.

If you wish to run back-end and front-end seperately. 
1. CD into 'server' and run "npm run start" 
2. open a new terminal simultaneously, and CD into 'client'. Run "npm start". 

This will execture the same as above. 

Hope you enjoy! :)
